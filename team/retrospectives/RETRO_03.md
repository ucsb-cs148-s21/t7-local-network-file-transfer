## Retro Assessment ##
For this retro we used a retro board with 3 columns labeled, Stop, Go, Continue, with the titles being pretty self explanatory. 
Overall the team is pretty satisfied with how the progress has been going so there was no much to say. The team looks forward to
continue working at the same pace as we have all quarter!
