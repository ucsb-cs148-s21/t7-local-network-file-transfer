# Retrospective 02 #

Team: 
- [x] Ethan Wu _(Retro Leader)_
- [x] Zackery Mondin
- [x] Douglas Yuan
- [x] Andrew Tran
- [x] Kevin Pham

## Action Items ##
- Set up multiple kanban boards and use them
- Continue collaborating and communicating through slack zoom etc
- Set specific goals for the sprint
- Divide up large tasks

## Retro Assessment ##
- We used the Start/Stop/Continue retrospective framework.
- Several good ideas for sprint 3 were suggested, mostly involving management of tasks per sprint.
- Next retro leader should try to help the team point out things that don't work, as the stop column is very short.

## Retro Outcome ##
Multiple kanban boards are functioning well, goals are all set and completed nicely, overall experiments went well. The increased organization from dividing up user and non-user stories made division of labor easier to envision for the duration of the sprint.
