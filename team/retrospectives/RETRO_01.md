## Action Items ##
- Need to increase communication between team members.
- Use Slack reply threads to organize communication and avoid intimidating team members.
- Since communication is primarily on Slack, more communication is immediately obvious.

## Retro Assessment
- A brief description of what retro outline or process you used: We used the quick retro template where we created a project board of: What was good?, What was bad?, Ideas, and Actions. 
- A brief assessment of how it went: The retro went well, we were able to discuss current team issues in a constructive manner.
- What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today: I would suggest finding a different retro so we can try other retro templates.
