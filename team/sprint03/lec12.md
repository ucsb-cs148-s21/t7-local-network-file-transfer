## Standup ##
- Ethan - Got the API feature branch up to parity with main. 
          Got multiple file upload working, but need to set up UI for multiple downloads. 
          Also figured out how to move unit tests out of src, and how to get GitHub automatic testing going.
          
- Zackery - Has been doing research on PyInstaller, and trying to get it to work on Windows. 
            Planning to keep working on it until it's good to go.
            
- Douglas - Worked on PyInstaller for Mac, didn't make much progress, was studying for midterm. Pretty close to getting it done.
            Getting file not found errors when running the .exe from the command line, could be fixed by implementing absolute imports.

- Kevin - Worked on UI, added logic for Python UI to cut off long file names. 
          Was able to make bubbles on web UI to show multiple file selections.
          
- Andrew - Got PyInstaller working on Linux by making a lot of relative imports absolute. Testing on VMs. 
           Will look into the multiple file sending feature. Blockers: assignments due tonight.
