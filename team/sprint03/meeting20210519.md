## Standup ##
- Ethan - Updated the README to describe the Loft repository structure. Plans to work on HTTPS task after meeting.
          
- Zackery - Messed with running priority of the app for Windows. Noticed Werkzeug server is single-threaded, maybe enabling
            multiple threads will help the performance. Plan on working on HTTPS task after meeting. Blockers: not sure what to do from here. 
            
- Douglas - Didn't make much progress since yesterday. Will start planning for the user manual and pick up a new issue to work on. 

- Kevin - Didn't do much since yesterday. Planning to look into editing JavaScript file to handle multiple uploads.
          
- Andrew - Worked on design doc. Plans to polish it up and find a way to upload the `.svg` file to GitHub, and start on multiple uploads. 
           Blockers: other homework.
