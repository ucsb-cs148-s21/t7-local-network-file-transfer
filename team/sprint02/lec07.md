## Standup ##
- Ethan - Reviewed Kevin's pull request. Created a UI. Upload button above download button so that the list of files can be put in a list.
- Zackery - Installed the base code into the machine. Had trouble to get it working but once it's fixed will work with Andrew to be able to figure out how to grab the user's IP.
- Douglas - Reviewed Ethan's pull request. Noticed that when you rotate the webpage on a mobile device the page will get kind of wonky. Making progress on the issue that he assigned himself to
- Kevin - Finished the HTML button and the upload functionality so that a user can upload from a device and it is stored on the device that the server is running on. Going to find a new issue to work on on the kanban board. 
- Andrew - Reviewing the new directory structure. Looking to finalize his branch.
